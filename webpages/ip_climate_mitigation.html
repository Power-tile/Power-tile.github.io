        <h2>Personal Climate Question: Which of your daily routine produces the most carbon?</h2>

                The more we consume, the more of the planet's resources we use, the more movement in production and distribution we generate, with the subsequent rise in CO2 emission figures.

        <h3>Interesting Facts on Producing Carbon</h3>
        <h4>Food</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 kg hard cheese generates 12 kg of CO2, which is the same amount a car produces
                when travelling 6 km, as well as growing 12 kg of carrots.
            </li>
            <li>If you're eating 444 calories a day of red meat (the equivalent of about one 8-ounce steak sirloin), your annual meat-related carbon footprint is 0.8 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Try switching things up with poultry, eggs, or even better, vegetables. Your carbon footprint will barely register.</li>
            <li>Carbon emission for different food servings: <br>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Transportation</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Gasoline releases 19.6 pounds of CO2 per gallon when burned, compared to 22.4 pounds per gallon for diesel. However, diesel has 11% more BTU per gallon, which improves its fuel economy.
            </li>
            <li>
                The average passenger car emits 0.79 pounds of CO2 per mile driven.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let's say you commute 30 miles round-trip to work, which was about average in 2003, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation. That's about 7,800 commuting miles each year. And if you drive a car that gets 22 miles to the gallon every weekday, your annual carbon footprint from commuting is 4.3 metric tons.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flying a 5000-mile round trip increases your carbon footprint by 2.23 tons of CO2.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Other Facts</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                For another completely everyday object, such as a mobile phone, just two minutes' daily use produces 47 kg of CO2 per year and an hour a day could produce the scandalous figure of 1,250 kg per year.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drying one load of laundry a week puts 0.1 metric tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. Hang them outside and save yourself $11 in electricity costs while you're at it.
            </li>
            <li>
                Running on a treadmill for 30 minutes three times a week will boost your carbon footprint by 0.07 metric tons per year. Take it outside and watch that number plummet to zero.
            </li>
        </ul>
