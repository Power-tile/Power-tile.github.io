                    <p>China is the most populous country in the world. And at the same time, its amount of emitting carbon is also much higher than other countries. As the time went by, the climate circumstances in China are not optimistic:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In 2008, the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stated that over the past century (1908-2007) the average temperature of the earth's surface in China has risen by 1.1 degrees Celsius. </li>
                        <li>The region containing the sources of the two major rivers in China, the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, used to be covered by around 1,369.86 km2 of glacier, whose abundant runoff provides water for both the Yangtze River and the Yellow River.</li>
                        <li>Global warming has a direct impact on China's coastal areas as the rise in average global temperature accelerates the melting of ice caps and increasing sea levels rise. The "2007 Sea Level Monitoring Report," released by China's State Oceanic Administration, indicated that the average sea level along Chinese coastal areas has increased by 90 millimeters (mm) over the past 30 years. Sea level around Tianjin has risen by 196 mm, more than double the average increase in China.</li>
                        <li>Glaciers melting in the Himalayas could lead to the overflow of 200 glacial lakes and produce large-scale flooding and mudslides in mountainous areas.</li>

                    <p><strong>Contributors: </strong>Frank (technical details), Daniel (calculation & logistics)</p>
                    <h4 id="h2-1-1">Technical Details</h3>
                    <p>According to Clean Energy Authority, there are 3 types of solar power system. </p>
                    <p>On-grid solar power system is the most cost-effective one. It connects the solar power system to the National Grid, by which people can sell back the surplus energy generated by the solar power system to the grid by net metering when the generated electric energy of the solar panel is more than the house consumption. They can also draw power from the grid if the generated energy cannot meet the demand for electricity of the house. </p>
                    <p>Choosing on-grid solar could help people recover their cost on establishing their solar power system rapidly. Constructing on-grid solar can save a lot of cost due to fewer required components (for instance, batteries and/or additional electric generators). Moreover, the cost can also be earned back by selling back the excess electricity to grid. Therefore, if the fund is tight, on-grid solar will be the best choice. </p>
                    <p>Different from on-grid solar, hybrid solar bring us better flexibility on electricity consumption. A hybrid solar includes an on-grid solar and a backup battery system, which can preserve the surplus electricity while necessary. Having a battery as a supplement make it easier to cope with energy shortfalls. By accessing to the grid, when the generated electricity from the solar panels cannot meet the demand of the house, people can draw energy from the grid (if the battery is empty) or use the energy stored in the battery. Also, when there is excess production, people can sell back the electricity to the grid (if the battery is full) or charge the battery. Therefore, a hybrid solar can be much more flexible than a simple on-grid solar.</p>
                    <p>However, every advantage has its disadvantage. Having a battery backup also risen the price of the whole system. It also increases the complexity and decreases the efficiency of the solar power system. </p>
                    <p>An off-grid solar electric power system is independent from the electric power grid. Therefore, to deal with energy shortfalls, batteries are necessary. Also, to confirm that 100% of the electricity in the house should be provided by solar power system, a set of solar panels with a larger scale than on-grid solar is required. Therefore, it would cost much more money than any of the previous two. That is also the reason why on-grid solar or hybrid solar are predominating the market of the residential solar systems. However, under very particular conditions (there are no local grid coverage or the efficiency of the local grid is very low), an off-grid solar is also useful. Well, it costs a lot for us to live normally off the system.</p>
                    <h4 id="h2-1-2">Calculations and Logistics</h3>
                    <p>After the technical details, I will go through the logistics and calculations needed for choosing the system. Because of the risk of having no power use and the big amount of usage, the "off-grid system" mentioned above is not taken into consider. Here we will go through the logic and calculations needed to determine whether the on-grid solar (aka grid system) is better, or the hybrid solar (aka battery system) is better.</p>
                    <p>Firstly, the differences between these systems:</p>
                    <table class="w-100 text-center table table-sm table-bordered">
                        <tr>
                            <th></th>
                            <th>Battery System</th>
                            <th>Grid System</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Use energy from outer grid</th>
                            <td>Yes</td>
                            <td>Yes</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Sell energy to outer grid</th>
                            <td>No</td>
                            <td>Yes</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Need Battery for backup</th>
                            <td>No</td>
                            <td>No</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Need Battery for Spare Energy</th>
                            <td>Yes</td>
                            <td>No</td>
                        </tr>
                    </table>

                    <p>Therfore, the key conditional statement that needs determination is:</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><code>Battery Cost + Money saved for not buying electricity ___ Money gained for selling electricity</code></p>
                    <p>If the former is bigger, battery system is more favorable; if the latter is bigger, the grid system is more favorable.</p>
                    <p>In order to determine the battery cost, we also need several portions of information. These information are listed in the table below.</p>

                    <p><strong>Needs:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Design and purchase the facilities of solar generating</li>

                    <img src="../asset/images/climate-handbook/pic2-2-1-1.jpg" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>Solar panels will first convert the sun's energy into direct current electricity. To store this energy, they need to convert it into chemical energy and store it in batteries. To meet the possible DC load of the new campus and protect the battery, a controller is required to control the battery's charging and discharging.</p>
                    <p>As the daily electricity demand of the campus is alternating current, the inverter is required to convert the direct current released from the battery to alternating current to meet the daily demand. The parameters such as voltage and current of each component in the whole system must be coordinated with each other. At the same time, we chose to tile the solar panels temporarily, which required custom Angle brackets or brackets for related PHOTOVOLTAIC equipment.</p>
                    <p><strong>Company: 北京昭丰源科技有限贵任公司</strong></p>
                    <p>Version 1:</p>
                    <img src="../asset/images/climate-handbook/pic2-2-1-2.png" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>This version contains some delicate instruments and they are not necessary for us to do the prototype. Thus the budget at first was very high, closed to 10000 RMB. Finally we checked the facilities above and communicated with the company to eliminate those precise equipments to control the cost.</p>
                    <p>Version 2:</p>
                    <img src="../asset/images/climate-handbook/pic2-2-1-3.png" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>This version is the final one with some basic facilites and suitable equipments to build our prototype. And the cost is also much cheaper than the first version.</p>
                    <p><strong>Design:</strong></p>
                    <p>After contacting many designers and architects, we learned that the prototype cannot be designed according to the standard of 500 (also 120) square meters, because the equipment applicable to 500 (also 120) square meters is not the same size as the equipment used by prototype, which is greatly different from each other. That means we can only design a small set of solar equipment as prototype.</p>
                    <p>Facilities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Polysilicon 320w solar panel * 1</li>
                        <li>220V50Hz inverter * 1</li>
                        <li>Charging controller * 1</li>
                        <li>Battery * 2</li>
                        <li>Bracket * 1</li>
                        <li>Pv cable * 15</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Considering that if we cannot get the donation or sponsorship from others, it is more likely we will use the grid-connected power system. Our prototype tries to imitate grid-connected power generation. However, we cannot personally connect the electricity to the household power distribution cabinet, so we use off-grid equipment such as battery and charging controller for this purpose, but we choose to connect to a large load, so that the battery of the solar panel is in an empty state during the generation process, so as to imitate the power generation efficiency when connected to the grid. And small power distribution cabinet is the special power distribution cabinet that is used when imitating grid connection. The bracket can adjust the Angle at any time, usually 32°, but we will change the Angle during the test to test the light intensity and other variables.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
                    <p>We had a great conversation with the clerk of that company. Through almost two months' work, we got a contract from the company. Now we have been approved by Moonshot. We are ready to sign this contract and send it back to the company!</p>

                    <h4 id="h2-2-2">Sensor Rig:</h4>
                    <p>For small-scaled prototyping of solar panel systems, only using the region data collected by various climate organizations is sufficient for estimating the power generation of the system. However, for the full system design, we need specific information on the solar radiation at different parts of our roof in order to determine the needed size of battery, inverters, and various other components.</p>
                    <p>We researched on high-level sensors that can autocollect data for more than 6 days, but none is available on the internet. In order to collect realistic data, we decided to design and build such a solar sensor rig to collect the data of solar radiation.</p>
                    <img src="../asset/images/climate-handbook/pic2-2-2-1.png" class="img-fluid">
                    <p class="text-secondary text-center">Sketch of Sensor Rig Prototyping</p>
                    <p>Every sensor rig contains three light intensity sensors. Two of them are fixed-direction sensors, while another one is constantly rotating, tracking the maximum solar radiation in the minute-long time interval along with its direction. This is for the decision of fixed-direction solar panel system / tracking solar panel system. In order to maintain the precision of the record, we uses two stepper motors and timer belts to rotate the third sensor.</p>
                    <p>Powered by an Arduino Mega board along with a card battery, this sensor rig is expected to run for more than 6 days, and all data will be collected and saved into an 64MB SD card. The data in the card will be extracted and analyzed using the Python language.</p>

                    <p>Each sensor rig is estimated to price about 850RMB.</p>
                    <p>Our design of the sensor rig is more than 90% finished. Parts needed design are: fastenizer for stablizing the gears, and the bottom side screw supports.</p>

                    <h6 id="h2-4-2-1-1">追梦筹网站上进行众筹活动</h6>
                    <p>链接：<a href="https://crowd.dreamore.com/project/view?project_id=1149838801" target="_blank">https://crowd.dreamore.com/project/view?project_id=1149838801</a></p>
                    <p>众筹是邀请普通的大众群体给我们项目支持。其中每个人给出的数目通常比较小，大概在几十块钱左右，通过较多的人数去获得一定金额的资金。众筹的资金数与赞助商相比就非常少了，所以众筹的钱只用来做项目前期的模型搭建，为5200元。</p>
                    <p>众筹可以分为4个部分：</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>建立众筹平台的账号</li>
                        <li>撰写项目介绍：包括故事、事实问题、项目计划和所需资金等等</li>
                        <li>确认回报机制</li>
                        <li>发布和传播</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>最后，在项目筹款成功后，还要根据回报机制去给到那些捐赠人。</p>
                    <p><u>第一步，建立众筹平台。</u>通过研究，在搞清楚了自己的项目属于哪里类型之后，选择恰当的众筹平台，建立账号。</p>
                    <p>我们的项目是一项纯公益类项目，最初就选择了比较有名的「腾讯公益」。一直到所有的项目资料都准备和撰写完毕，才发现「腾讯公益」开启一个众筹项目必须有相关合作的公募机构认领。我们联系不上任何公募机构，于是只好另想策略。最后我们选择了一款手机app众筹平台：「追梦筹」。这个平台上的项目所需信息和运行模式就简单多了，拿着之前有的信息我们花了1个多小时就发布了众筹。不过同时，这个平台甚至不需要身份验证，在安全和人气上面就没法与「腾讯公益」相比较了。</p>
                    <p><u>第二步，撰写项目介绍。</u>在撰写项目介绍的时候我们参考了很多已经发起的众筹项目，并且总结了那些筹款进度比较好的项目的特点。最后得到了一个项目介绍的撰写结构，大概就是从故事开头，随后进入事实问题的描述，再讨论一下我们的计划，最后按照众筹项目所需的内容填写，包括团队介绍和所需资金等等。</p>
                    <p>我们项目的故事就采用了项目成员Billy的一段对白。Billy是上海人，气候变暖在逐渐导致海平面的上升，大海很可能在未来的几十年内淹没他的故乡。
                        事实问题的描述我们主要分为两部分，从日常生活里气候变化带给我们影响，一直到2020年初的大灾难与气候变化的相关性，渐进的指出问题的根源和其严重性。
                        最后我们讲述自己要做的事情，并且说明此项目对于气候变化问题的改善效果。
                        在所需资金的说明里，清晰讲述众筹的资金将用在项目哪个部分，以及此部分的重要性。</p>
                    <p><u>第三步，确认回报机制。</u>这部分就是要设定好，每个人捐助不同金额所能得到的回报是什么。可以根据项目的情况去设计这部分，并且承诺那些有价值和意义，且能做到的回报。</p>
                    <p><u>第四步，发布和传播。</u>在项目的资料和内容都准备齐全之后，就可以发布了。发布后要怎样能让更多的人参与捐助呢？我们的答案可能就是：多传播。通过朋友圈或者群聊的转发，让更多人看到项目，并且参与捐助。</p>
                    <p>大概就是这些了，记得在众筹结束后精心准备给捐助人的回报哦！</p>

                    <h4 id="h2-6-2">What is required to be carbon neutral in terms of electricity in our new campus?</h4>
                    <p>At the present moment, we have an area of 120 m² which can be used for solar panels. If the whole area is covered with solar panels in a battery system, we estimate that the system can produce 21120 kWh of electricity each year. However, this only covers around 6% of the schools annual electricity consumption estimated at 350000 kWh/year. By using a grid system that sell all energy produced rather than consume it directly, we estimate that it can produce 35040 kWh annually. However, the downside of the grid-system is the longer return on the investment. Selling electricity to the grid only pays 0.18 RMB/kWh while buying electricity from the grid costs around 0.78 RMB/kWh. Therefore, a grid-system on the school would need to run for 31 years before it would break even in cost, in comparison to a battery-system which would break even around 10 years.</p>
                    <p>By installing the battery-system and supplying the school with renewable energy, 6% of it's electcity usage would come from renewable sources. For the remaining 94% of the electricity use, we have a few options.</p>
                    <h5 id="h2-6-2-1">1) Ensure that we purchase energy from certified renewable sources</h5>
                    <p class="text-secondary">
                        <u>What are Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)?</u><br>
                        Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs), also known as green energy certificates or tradable renewable certificates are proof that energy has been generated from renewable sources such as solar or wind power. Each REC represents the environmental benefits of 1MWh of renewable energy generation. When you purchase RECs, renewable energy is generated on your behalf.
                    </p>
                    <p>Recommended by our external supporter from Greenpeace, the <a href="http://greenenergy.org.cn/" target="_blank">Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs)</a> can be purchased for each kWh of electricity used in our campus. These certificates will ensure that renewable energy was generated for the amount used by our campus. The positive side is that we are supporting large-scale facilities around China, while the negative side is that we pay more than the grid price for the electricity and not reaping the benefits of investing in renewable energy.</p>
                    <h5 id="h2-6-2-2">2) Expand the solar system to the roof of other buildings surrounding the school</h5>
                    <p>Buy investing and installing a local solar system, costs can be saved in the long-term.</p>
                    <p>While the MSA campus roof is used for social life, exercise and other equipment for the building, other buildings within the 塑三文化创意园区 do not use the roof for anything productive. This is an opportunity to make use of unused resources, but while it might save costs in the long-term, it will be more complicated compared to purchasing certificates of renewable energy.</p>
                    
                    <p><strong>Comparing the costs</strong></p>
                    <p>Expanding our PV solar system would be more complicated than puchasing carbon offsetting, but cheaper over time. See the table below for a price comparison.</p>

                    based on climate change, we found the action we want to take in order to better solve this problem: build solar
                    system on our campus roof. then, the objectives was been defined and we found the reasons of why we were going this

                <p>We still deemed that meeting offline was possible. Even the least idealistic goal was to install 10% of solar panels
                    on the roof. </p>
                <p>The fact was sooner or later was to be known that we couldn't come back to the campus, therefore could not even build
                    a real prototype. Based on this realization, we had another goal orientation meeting at May 12th. By this time,
                    there is generally one month left before the blank week started. </p>
                <p>What are list below were the final outcome:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Finish a prototype that can charge a phone or laptop to full battery using solar<br>
                        完成一个原型，可以使用太阳能为手机或笔记本电脑充电，使其充满电</li>
                    <li>A finished design for a system that can power the new campus<br>
                        一个能为新校区部分供电的系统设计</li>
                    <li>Raise 5000 RMB for a prototype<br>
                        为原型筹集5000元</li>
                    <li>Publish a handbook to help guide other students to launch their own solar project<br>
                        制作一本手册，帮助指导其他学生启动自己的太阳能项目</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Though we replaced the actual installment (installing on campuc roof) of the system by other products such as
                    handbook, we still included the installment of prototype in the plan, which, later, we were failed again. I suppose
                    the reason that we made an unrealistic plan twice was that we kept hoping for the best. So, if we do it all over
                    again, I will adviced the people who are in charge of the orientation meeting agenda to hope for and plan BOTH the
                    best and the worst. </p>
                <h5>How did we make sure that the whole team has an opportunity to speak and give input before changing big decisions?
                </h5>
                <a href="https://shimo.im/docs/GokLVrJDo2iBF032/" target="_blank">20200512 NEW GOAL</a>
                <p>one of the big decisions that we have changed in our project was when the time we changed our project outcome.
                    because of the virus situation, we can not go back to our school campus and to actually build the solar systems on
                    the roof, so our biggest project outcome can not be achieved. then, we have to change our project outcome and to
                    comes with a new plan on what are we going to produce at the end of the semester. </p>
                <p>to making sure that the whole team has an opportunity to speak and give input before changing this big decision, our
                    team has organized a meeting to let everyone shared:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>If we can't install solar panels on the roof of the school, what's an alternative outcome that can make us feel
                        accomplished this semester?</li>
                    <li>In what shape do you hope this project can continue next semester?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Here are some of the answers:</p>
                <!--图片-->
                <p>lastly, we sumed up all these ideas in to four parts, and these became our prject new outcome that has included
                    everyone's participation and contribution:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Finishing a small prototype 完成一个小原型</li>
                    <li>A project plan / handbook for other to continue the project 项目计划/手册，供其他人继续项目</li>
                    <li>Track the data about our electricity/carbon footprint 跟踪我们的电力/碳足迹数据</li>
                    <li>Start captial for continuation of projet next semester 开始下学期继续项目的资金</li>
                </ol>
                <p>in addition, after we made our new desicion about the project outcome, our team coaches have also talk to everyone
                    1-on-1, to asked them how were they doing and also they feelings toward this new desicion. </p>

                <h5 id="h3-1-2-1">How did we distribute tasks, and meet deadlines?</h5>
                <p>Leader's group meet once a week on Monday between 5:30-6:30. During this particular meeting, leaders and coaches
                    balance information with each other to have a big picture of our project. Through those understanding, we
                    instantly make adjustments. For example, when we are seeing that tasks are close to be finished, lead group
                    members would propose ideas about how we are going to divide our tasks next. </p>
                <p>If one meeting involves too much topics to be discussed, we will divide and set deadlines for the tasks between
                    us. For leaders, the deadlines are always quite urgent, because we need to swiftly catch up current situation.
                    Jaguar and Jonathan, two of our team coaches, once constructed a more organised Gannt Chart structure using the
                    similar logic of WBS (Work Breakdown Structure). The rest of lead's group including Daniel, Billy of Engineering
                    group, and Laurence, Cindy of the finance group provided feedbacks on the updated Gannt Chart. We then held
                    another meeting to furthur clarify distribution of responsibilities. For instance, we mark up the person(s) who
                    would be in charge of a certain task. Note that the names in bold are the owner of the task. To clarify an only
                    owner is important because this is making people more certain about their works, so that they will not be upset
                    by different expectations, also be more responsible for their own tasks. </p>
                <!--图片-->
                <p>Then, engineering finance team leaders and coaches respectively draw timelines for the tasks. We usually start by
                    setting milestones within a task (denoting the darker colours), then it would easier to complete the rest of the
                    timeline. </p>
                <!--图片-->
                <p>What is introduced above is how we oversee the tasks. What's more, the owners of tasks check usually check
                    progress of their tasks in check-ins - a 30 minutes' meeting between 8:00-8:30 every morning. At every Monday,
                    our routine schedule is to check the tasks on Gannt Chart and divide the task with more details. We use
                    Microsoft Planner to do this. Important tasks are checked with special attention. For example, some of the
                    engineering members held a meeting to evaluate the completion of sensor rig. The team coaches and leaders, who
                    are willing to support other members, not only give reminders when the tasks are going to be overdue, but also
                    provide people support in any forms. </p>
                <p>*The approach that I mentioned above is called Gannt Chart is a visualised team management tool (Click "Gannt
                    Chart" to view our Gannt Chart). </p>
                <h5 id="h3-1-2-2">How to leaders hold periodic reflections?</h5>
                <p>Minor reflections happen every Monday in leaders' routine meeting, where we have informal reflections for the
                    passing week(s). Based on these reflections, we construct actions plan for following days. </p>
                <p>However, a formal reflection meeting is critically required sometimes. At the beginning of the project, in
                    addition to the form of online collaboration, all of us are not farmiliar with each other, which made our
                    collaboration and progress even more inproductive. So, one of the leaders proposed the idea of a formal
                    reflection meeting to reflect on the teamwork. </p>
                <!--图片-->
                <p>Leaders and coaches realized a bigger picture of the issue (teamwork) and settled matters such as the co-build
                    activity for the whole team. Click into the link: Leader's Reflection Meeting at 2020/4/6 to see more details.

                    <p><strong>Key Contributors: </strong>Jaguar, Cindy</p>
                    <h5 id="h3-1-3-1">How do we keep track of our information and materials? </h5>
                    <p>During the project reflection session, together we made a general project timeline. All of our documents,
                        evidence, including this timeline, are this shared shimo folder. When the project just started, we used
                        Microsoft OneDrive. Although Jaguar and Jonathan instructed us in such details about how to download related
                        applications, I personally didn't get used to use OneDrive before we transform the documentating platform
                        into shimo. Shimo is easier to operate, and in which people could see who are editing at the same time (so
                        that we could remind people to focus on the task). I suppose we should brainstorm some "must-dos" before the
                        project officialy starts, where we could have thought about the improtance of documentation. Then, leaders
                        could arrange a short platform research session. </p>
                    <!--圖片-->
                    <h5 id="h3-1-3-2">How did we assess our progress and growth? </h5>
                    <p>Jaguar and Jonathan is in charge of designing the weighing of different sections, which could be tracked
                        in Master Plan. On the other side, we link our evidence in MATRIX. When we link photos and sections in
                        individual folders, the block of the corresponding skill could be truned green. The project coaches verify
                        the
                        skills by turning the green boxes into blue, meaning we have reached the advanced level. The evaluation is
                        not
                        only being counted in GPA, but also a great approach to review a semester-long work, receive feedbacks and
                        future improvements.
                    </p>
                    <!--圖片-->
                    <p>GPA was calculated from 4 main areas: weekly blogs (10%), soft skills (30%), knowledge skills (30%), and
                        project
                        completion (30%). You can see more about how they were broken down in the picture below:

                    <!--圖片-->
                    <p>The MATRIX was mainly used as a means to document the hard skills and knowledge we were learning throughout
                        the
                        project, while blogs and feedback to our peers were used to help us reflect on our progress and improve our
                        soft
                        skills. We tracked blogs in the MASTER PLAN in a specific Blog Records tab: </p>
                    <!--圖片-->
                    <p>As for Feedback, periodically we would fill in a chart to give feedback to every member on our sub-group
                        teams. We
                        even gave each other detailed feedback on our specific selected skill strands we each wanted to improve
                        throughout
                        the project according to our school's competency rubrics. Then we would self report how many feedbacks we
                        wrote to
                        our peers and the 15% portion of our grade dependent on feedback was calculated: </p>

                    <h5 id="h3-1-4-1">How we created a lead group and met weekly? </h5>
                    <p>The kick-off meeting of Climate Mitigation should be the first lead group meeting. The leaders are who either
                        volunteered as leaders, or encouraged by the coaches to be leaders. Leaders have been adjusting our roles.
                        We were
                        initially responsible for planning check-ins and IP sessions, later, we found that the working pattern was
                        unproductive, and that when the project progressed, people need more working time. Gradually, it had became
                        a
                        routine where Jaguar and Jonathan facilitated the check-ins, and us (learner leaders) lead the working time
                        in
                        seperated groups. </p>
            
                    <h5 id="h3-1-4-2">What was the role, responsibilities and expectations of Leads?</h5>
                    <p>The team leaders in this project each take on one area of responsibility (i.e. Engineering System Design,
                        Fundraising or Public Relations/Communication). While they have the final say and responsibility in their
                        area, they all share the work of managing the whole team, the resources we have available and making the
                        best use of our limited time. This include making decision on our strategy, what work is important at what
                        time and the division of work across the team.</p>
                    <p>We expect the team leaders to be self-directed, take initiative when observing problems or misunderstandings,
                        and seek out help from project coaches or team members when needed. As project coaches, we expect team
                        leaders to tell us when we’re stepping over our boundary, and when we’re not being supportive enough.</p>
                    <p>The team leaders are responsible for the project outcome in terms of their chosen role (area of
                        responsibility). They are also responsible for facilitating the majority of working time, and together with
                        coaches, invite more experienced people to teach the team the skills we need at the right moment. Team
                        leaders are responsible for the team members under their area of responsibility, to make sure that everyone
                        is clear on the work that needs to be done, and make sure that there’s a balanced division of work. Team
                        leaders are also responsible to inform project coaches when the team is having problems that are difficult
                        to solve.</p>
            
                    <h5 id="h3-1-4-3">Why did we split into Engineering and Finance?</h5>
                    <p>In the coaches' mind, the project could be divided into three sections: Engineering, Finance and Public
                        Relations&Documentation. While Billy and Daniel were the leaders of Engineering team, Laurence and Yang are
                        the leaders of Finance. When we guadually gained more knowledge about what our works looked like, we merged
                        the Public Relations&Documentation section into Finance. Firstly, we only have seven persons in finance
                        group. Also, applying donors' investment or raise crowdfunding could not be donw without PR&Documentation.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4 id="h3-1-5">Coaches</h4>
                    <p><strong>Key Contributors: </strong> Jaguar, Cindy</p>
                    <h5><strong>What was the role of the Coaches?</strong></h5>
                    <p>In the Climate Action theme, a project coach is essentially what a basketball coach is for the basketball team, but for our project team. The project coach will assign leaders (like team captains) who already have sufficient experience and track record, while providing strategies for working together as a team. He/she will leave room for each team member to let their strengths shine on the field while giving support and advice for improving their current struggles.</p>
                    <p>The project coaches will have more professional experience than the team members and will thus help the team avoid common mistakes and stay on track to achieve our goal. At the same time, the project coach will not get on the field in a game to score a goal for the team and then sit back down, but rather work with the team members to improve their practice (and get tough when they are wasting their potential at the cost of the team).</p>
                    <p>The responsibility of project coaches are to guarantee that all learners in the project have the chance to and can reach the learning goals. At the same time, they are also partly responsible for the whole project outcome.</p>
                    <p>The project coaches are also responsible for everyone’s equal opportunity to grow themselves and learn about the content relevant to the project. This may include developing personalized learning paths for team members, finding helpful resources, as well as helping team members to compromise and solve conflicts that are going out of hand.</p>
                    <h5><strong>From Leaners perspective, how did the coaches assists us and coach our project?</strong></h5>
                    <p>Jonathan, Jaguar and Lidiia were Climate Mitigation's project coaches. While Jonathan worked along Finance group and Jaguar worked in Engineering group, Lidiia was our fund-raising expert, our special guest.</p>
                    <p>To extend what are described above (it became a routine...sperated groups), coaches seem didn't provide us too much "visible support", but rather many "invisible support" like encouragements and conversations. In the middle of the project, when we encountered many tensions in teamwork, coaches were defining their roles as well. Jonathan felt that he had taken part in our work too much, considering how to reach a balance between autonomy and control. </p>
                    <p>Through the conversations with Jonathan I realized that coaches were similar with us--trying to find weakness and seeking to break through the obstacles or comforst zones. These are what learners comment on coaches concern and the coaches themselves: </p>
                    <p>"老张在学期末的时候和项目开始的时候很不一样了，我觉得老张更愿意去带领我们，在团队组织里参与了更多。老张有的时候会担心自己做的太多了，不过我个人觉得没什么问题，因为当老张和抱抱去更多的带领团队的时候，我其实有更多的安全感，也感觉团队是更稳定的。"</p>
                    <p>"Lidiia是一个我们找反馈一定会去的地方，每次给的feedback都很有建设性，我觉得是一个很会从其他角度去看待我们项目的人，这个人我觉得也是非常重要的，有了这个人之后我， 才能用不同人的角度看待一个问题，有了不一样的效果和解释。"</p>
                    <p>“Dude I am so grateful that you were here to support us and give much feedback to our project. I was tripped out when I led the team to design the full system. It was you that inspired me and pushed my primative thought on the final system. Also, you did a great job answering a lot of questions raised by us. I would remember the time that we discussed the battery stuuff during the late night. In general, thx Jag!“</p>

                    <h5><strong>What are the advantages and disadvantages as a really big project group?</strong></h5>
                    <p>Climate Mitigation project group has the most people than other IP projects--we have fifteen learners and three project coaches. Though it seems that the disadvantages are brought by the self-identification of big project group, the truth st more complicated than that. Here, I am only trying to do a brief analysis, which might not include the full picture. 
                        In two different perspectives, we are both a big and a small project group, which respectively bring forth advantages and disadvantages. </p>

                                <li>Hard to manage and communicate</li>
                                <p>The motivation of joining the project varies between individuals. The larger the people, the harder it is to form private environment to have deeper communication. Without connection and trust being built, it was harder to have effective team management, such as making sure to follow the deadline. This situation is heightened by the irreversible online-working environment, the unfamiliarity between new learners (2019) and founding learners (2018). Particularly, when there are learners who had not discovered deep motivation for this project, on the one hand we need to proceed the challenging project speedily, on the other hand building connections with those learners and helping them to find motivation are necessary for proceeding the project, which cost great energy and time. </p>
