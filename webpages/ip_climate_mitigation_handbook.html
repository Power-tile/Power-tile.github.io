                    <h3 id="h1-1-1">China (Billy)</h3>
                    <p>China is the most populous country in the world. And at the same time, its amount of emitting carbon is also much higher than other countries. As the time went by, the climate circumstances in China are not optimistic:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In 2008, the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stated that over the past century (1908-2007) the average temperature of the earth's surface in China has risen by 1.1 degrees Celsius. </li>
                        <li>The region containing the sources of the two major rivers in China, the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, used to be covered by around 1,369.86 km2 of glacier, whose abundant runoff provides water for both the Yangtze River and the Yellow River.</li>
                        <li>Global warming has a direct impact on China's coastal areas as the rise in average global temperature accelerates the melting of ice caps and increasing sea levels rise. The "2007 Sea Level Monitoring Report," released by China's State Oceanic Administration, indicated that the average sea level along Chinese coastal areas has increased by 90 millimeters (mm) over the past 30 years. Sea level around Tianjin has risen by 196 mm, more than double the average increase in China.</li>
                        <li>Glaciers melting in the Himalayas could lead to the overflow of 200 glacial lakes and produce large-scale flooding and mudslides in mountainous areas.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4 id="h2-1-1">Technical Details</h3>
                    <h4 id="h2-1-2">Calculations and Logistics</h3>
                    <p>After the technical details, I will go through the logistics and calculations needed for choosing the system (grid system vs battery system).</p>
                    <p>Firstly, the differences between these systems:</p>
                    <table class="w-100 text-center" border="1">
                        <tr>
                            <th></th>
                            <th>Battery System</th>
                            <th>Grid System</th>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Use energy from outer grid</th>
                            <td>Yes</td>
                            <td>Yes</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Sell energy to outer grid</th>
                            <td>No</td>
                            <td>Yes</td>
                            </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Need Battery for backup</th>
                            <td>No</td>
                            <td>No</td>
                            </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Need Battery for Spare Energy</th>
                            <td>Yes</td>
                            <td>No</td>
                            </tr>
                    </table>

                    <p>Therfore, the key conditional statement that needs determination is:</p>
                    <p class="text-center"><code>Battery Cost + Money saved for not buying electricity ___ Money gained for selling electricity</code></p>
                    <p>If the former is bigger, battery system is more favorable; if the latter is bigger, the grid system is more favorable.</p>
                    <p>In order to determine the battery cost, we also need several portions of information. These information are listed in the table below.</p>

                    <h4 id="h2-2-1">Solar Panel:</h4>
                    <p><strong>Needs:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Design and purchase the facilities of solar generating</li>
                        <li>Simulate the working condition of the final system</li>
                        <li>Provide pratical facilities for Sensor Rig to do the data analysis</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>Strategy:</strong></p>
                    <img src="../asset/images/climate-handbook/pic2-2-1-1.jpg" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>Solar panels will first convert the sun's energy into direct current electricity. To store this energy, they need to convert it into chemical energy and store it in batteries. To meet the possible DC load of the new campus and protect the battery, a controller is required to control the battery's charging and discharging.</p>
                    <p>As the daily electricity demand of the campus is alternating current, the inverter is required to convert the direct current released from the battery to alternating current to meet the daily demand. The parameters such as voltage and current of each component in the whole system must be coordinated with each other. At the same time, we chose to tile the solar panels temporarily, which required custom Angle brackets or brackets for related PHOTOVOLTAIC equipment.</p>
                    <p><strong>Company: 北京昭丰源科技有限贵任公司</strong></p>
                    <p>Version 1:</p>
                    <img src="../asset/images/climate-handbook/pic2-2-1-2.png" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>This version contains some delicate instruments and they are not necessary for us to do the prototype. Thus the budget at first was very high, closed to 10000 RMB. Finally we checked the facilities above and communicated with the company to eliminate those precise equipments to control the cost.</p>
                    <p>Version 2:</p>
                    <img src="../asset/images/climate-handbook/pic2-2-1-3.png" class="img-fluid">
                    <p>This version is the final one with some basic facilites and suitable equipments to build our prototype. And the cost is also much cheaper than the first version.</p>
                    <p><strong>Design:</strong></p>
                    <p>After contacting many designers and architects, we learned that the prototype cannot be designed according to the standard of 500 (also 120) square meters, because the equipment applicable to 500 (also 120) square meters is not the same size as the equipment used by prototype, which is greatly different from each other. That means we can only design a small set of solar equipment as prototype.</p>
                    <p>Facilities:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Polysilicon 320w solar panel * 1</li>
                        <li>220V50Hz inverter * 1</li>
                        <li>Charging controller * 1</li>
                        <li>Battery * 2</li>
                        <li>Bracket * 1</li>
                        <li>Pv cable * 15</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Considering that if we cannot get the donation or sponsorship from others, it is more likely we will use the grid-connected power system. Our prototype tries to imitate grid-connected power generation. However, we cannot personally connect the electricity to the household power distribution cabinet, so we use off-grid equipment such as battery and charging controller for this purpose, but we choose to connect to a large load, so that the battery of the solar panel is in an empty state during the generation process, so as to imitate the power generation efficiency when connected to the grid. And small power distribution cabinet is the special power distribution cabinet that is used when imitating grid connection. The bracket can adjust the Angle at any time, usually 32°, but we will change the Angle during the test to test the light intensity and other variables.</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong></p>
                    <p>We had a great conversation with the clerk of that company. Through almost two months' work, we got a contract from the company. Now we have been approved by Moonshot. We are ready to sign this contract and send it back to the company!</p>

                    <h4 id="h2-2-2">Sensor Rig:</h4>
                    <p>For small-scaled prototyping of solar panel systems, only using the region data collected by various climate organizations is sufficient for estimating the power generation of the system. However, for the full system design, we need specific information on the solar radiation at different parts of our roof in order to determine the needed size of battery, inverters, and various other components.</p>
                    <p>We researched on high-level sensors that can autocollect data for more than 6 days, but none is available on the internet. In order to collect realistic data, we decided to design and build such a solar sensor rig to collect the data of solar radiation.</p>
                    <img src="../asset/images/climate-handbook/pic2-2-2-1.png" class="img-fluid">
                    <p class="text-secondary text-center">Sketch of Sensor Rig Prototyping</p>
                    <p>Every sensor rig contains three light intensity sensors. Two of them are fixed-direction sensors, while another one is constantly rotating, tracking the maximum solar radiation in the minute-long time interval along with its direction. This is for the decision of fixed-direction solar panel system / tracking solar panel system. In order to maintain the precision of the record, we uses two stepper motors and timer belts to rotate the third sensor.</p>
                    <p>Powered by an Arduino Mega board along with a card battery, this sensor rig is expected to run for more than 6 days, and all data will be collected and saved into an 64MB SD card. The data in the card will be extracted and analyzed using the Python language.</p>

                    <p>Each sensor rig is estimated to price about 850RMB.</p>
                    <p>Our design of the sensor rig is more than 90% finished. Parts needed design are: fastenizer for stablizing the gears, and the bottom side screw supports.</p>
