            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>As a "Computer Science" person ("CSer") and someone who would like to continue learning in computer science in the future, this is probably
                the year of great growth and changes for myself. The width of my learnings greatly aggregated; the depth deepened; and much more
                projects I done is more related to my own life and people's needs.
            </p>
            <p>In this webpage, I will briefly talk about my XA Artifact for Defense 2020: My Coding Experience this year. I will divide my experience 
                into several sections by content/method of learning, along with various evidences, videos, image peaks, and webpage contents that are parts
                of my learning.
            </p>
            <p>My learning can be briefly divided into 3 big parts: web development, other developments, and teaching/tutorials. I will give an overall
                introduction of what each part is about in this <em>Introduction</em>, and detailed subitems are shown below.
            </p>
            <p>For the <strong>Web Development</strong> part, I engaged in different web application projects that connects to real life. For
                <strong>Other Developments</strong>, I continued what I did last year and started learning data science; for <strong>Teaching/Tutorial</strong>,
                which is one of my OKRs from the beginning, I actively shared what I possess to others.
            </p>
            <p>My learning processes mostly exist in the form of BL, and a small part was done via learning in courses. My primary information sites are
                the documentation of the tool I am currently using, stackoverflow (an online coding forum), and CSDN.
            </p>
            <p><em>Special Thanks</em> to Jerry and Zhouzhou, for their lasting support on my learning and questions; to the participants of my workshop
                and classes, who gave wonderful feedbacks; to teammates of various projects, for working together.</p>

            <p>In the course <em>Computer Science 2</em>, I learned about Java, Spring, Springboot, AOP, OOP Principles, SQL + JPA, and more technologies.
                These seemingly terrifying names are targetting to build a website with a healthy database that stores the information of users as well 
                as keeping track of all actions, a backend client that helps handling users' requests, and a frontend webpage which the user can view
                and facilitate their needs with an user interface.
            </p>
            <p>Our final project in this course is to build a virtual "vending machine" website. Users can select their products, choose various discounts
                to spend less money, and buy their products. This website is connected to a database which holds the information of products and users' 
                accounts.
            </p>
            <p>A sneak peek to the user interface of my vending machine project:</p>

            <p class="text-secondary">P.S. This webpage needs to run on a server that provides the appropriate environment, and a special server needs to be rented for 
                running the backend of this webpage. It is a pity that you cannot try the selection process by yourself.

            <p>Dashboard is a platform for publishing school information and status of learners (for example, rate of attendance, 
                competency level, learning evidences, milestone grades and comments), facing guardians (faculty members), learners, and parents. 
                I engaged in both development processes for Dashboard 1 and Dashboard 2 in this year.</p>
            <p>For Dashboard 1, I engaged in small-scale full stack development since March 2019. A screenshot from the old version of Dashboard 1:</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../../asset/images/dashboard-1-demo.png">
            <p class="text-secondary">P.S. This is the old version of dashboard and this screenshot is from an expired message in the dev group chat.
                Currently the newest data is hosted on Dashboard 2, and a screen capture of the current Dashboard 1 will be mostly blank (no data imported).
            </p>

            <p>For Dashboard 2, I focused on frontend development and finished about 60% of the frontend page since the beginning
                of the spring semester of 2020. In this process I also learned and used a new UI library called <code>Bootstrap</code>. A screenshot

            <p>Frank and I was collaborating on coding the program for sensor rig. I know that Frank is quite clear about the actual code needed
                for controlling the sensors, and we covered all basic information needed to interpret a new arduino library in our SCP C++ Workshop
                (see below). However, he never collaborated coding with others before, and he is not very familiar with the algorithm used or the design
                of the sensor rig physical structure (which was done by me). Therefore, I decided to write the skeleton of the code, only declaring but not
                defining the control functions. A peak to the skeleton I wrote:

            <p>In this passing semester, I also learned more on computer graphics and computer vision, which I learned last summer

            <p>As an engineerer, I often have the need of drawing engineering drafts. However, multiple drafts are often needed to show a complicated
                3D physical structure, and direct modelling using modelling softwares are too tedious. Moreover, creating on top of existing scenes 
                (for example, adding a new shelf into makerspace) includes lots of drawings of an existing scene.
            </p>
            <p>In order to facilitate this problem, I decided to develop a "3D Sketching" tool aiming to sketch in three dimensional; 3D reconstruction
                based on 2D images; adding annotations and textures; etc.

            <p>Developing in Vue.js and Iview UI, I found that both analyzing the code from an existing project and starting from scratch are not 
                the best way of learning these (because of the vast knowledge points in both libraries). Therefore, I created a github project called
                "Vue Playground" and added a few challenges + code needed to interpret it. A challenge completed may look like this:

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>This is perhaps the most vigorous year of my learning in computer science. Not only do I know more about this region and keep learning,
                I also feel that I am confident on "learning how to learn". Now I could use resources available much better, including listening to short 
                classes on Tencent Course, asking questions on stackoverflow, opening issues on other's Github Repositories, and of course,
                asking for help from our guardians.
            </p>
            <p>Throughout my learning, I am also more familiar with the differences between different languages and tools, as well as their meaning
                in the big picture. When a learner asked me why github was a word he often heard and see when browsing for coding contents on the Internet,
                I answered the question in three ways: function of Github, community in Github, and the spirit of collaboration. I could also summarize quickly 
                the learning patterns of mine to those who are trying to learn it.
            </p>
            <p>Another significant improvement is that I am creatively linking what I know to the problems in real world. The SCP Vending Machine, Dashboard, 
                3D Sketching tool, and sensor rig are all derived from real problems and needs I encountered in reality. Each of them had gone through a 
                creative designing process. They went through the process of brainstorming, surveying, analyzing advantages and disadvantages, and countless
                iterations.
            </p>
            <p>I also had many thoughts and experiences on making tutorials/teaching. From the start of my Moonshot Journey, one of my Objectives in my OKR
                is that "I want to share what I have and value to others". By opening up workshops, taking notes and create open-source challenges,
                make my projects public, sharing and compiling online resources, I realized "learning how to learn" doesn't necessary mean evaluating yourself,
                giving yourself feedback and reflect on your self, but also share boldly what you have to others.
            </p>
            <p>One specific point I want to talk about in my teaching process is my ability of "linking". I always love linking different knowledge points 
                together, and this is one of the reasons I love learning history and computer science. Through teaching and reflecting, I am able to link 
                knowledge and spirit from the coding world into others things I like. For example, the question on the significance of Github not only helped me
                summarizing my own thoughts, but also inspired my Western Philosophy paper on ethics, where I talk about the negative sides of the Internet.
            </p>
            <p>For many times, I resembled coding to writing poems, given that they are artifacts that follow certain rules, contain certain rhythms,
                and reflect on the author's thoughts and logic. Through my learning of computer science, I would say I gained more than just knowledge,
                but also reflections, warmth, learning how to learn, and thinking creatively.
            </p>
            <p>In the future, I will continue my learning in web development, and also delve into the field of mobile development, game development, 
                and other aspects. I will also pass on what I have learned to others. For my skills and competencies, I will continue exploring new ways 
                of learning, searching for information, solving new problems, and create innovative projects.
