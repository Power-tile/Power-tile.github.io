                    <h3>1. Thoughts Towards Driving Questions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Due to the limits of time and money, I came up with several driving questions, with their content and technical difficulties shown below.
                        <table>
                            <thead>

                                </tr>
                            </thead>
                            <tbody>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>How to construct a pure optical logic gate?</td>
                                    <td>This is the first question being proposed. We already came up with a design of pure optical logic gates, but it requires
                                        polarization lens as well as semi-reflective glasses which we cannot afford.
                                    </td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>How to achieve 4D Modelling with Computer Graphics?</td>
                                    <td>This hypothesis is not achievable under the restrictions of the current time. Therefore, I will ponder through this question
                                        in my final project.

                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>How to create life using Persistent of Vision?</td>
                                    <td>This is my final driving question in this project. To build a "life", I uses an Arduino Mega, 1 accelerometer, 32 LEDs, 2 Breadboards,

                            </tbody>
                        </table>
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Thoughts before the project</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am a computer scientist, therefore considers everything in a logical and computer-based way. I consider our world as a giant system,
                        where everything acts based on fundamental rules (for example, gravity). Similarly, I can create a different world in the field of computer science
                        with new rules and new principles. This is one of the reasons of why I like computer science: you are the god of your own world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While thinking of putting art and science together, I thought of creating a "life" that follows rules, seemingly spontaneous, reacts, and tells.
                        Therefore, I designed this "life" that behaves on its own, obeying certain rules, and transfers information to us by rotating itself and using the
                         "persistent of vision" (POV) with LEDs.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Research</h3>
                    <p>After doing a brief research on sound and sound waves, I decided to go deeper in the aspect of the production and receiving of sounds. 
                        The basic results and elements of my research is shown below.
                    </p>

                    <h4>The basic properties of sound waves</h4>
                    <p>We all know that sound has three basic properties: loudness, tune, and tone. Loudness specifies the intensity of the sound, tune the acuteness,
                        and tone the style. However, this principle can be explained in a more fundamental way.
                    </p>
                    <p>We all know that sound takes the form of a wave, in the meantime being a function of time. Therefore, sound can be analyzed as mathematical wave functions.
                        For a mathematical function, the most important properties are the amplitude and the wavelength, which stands for the intensity of fluctuating
                        and the length between two crests/two troughs, respectively, as shown in the diagram below.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../asset/images/math_wave_properties.jpg">
                    <p>From the mathematic perspective, it is easy to notice that the loudness and tune correlates with the amplitude and wavelength of the soundwaves.
                        However, for the tone of the sound, it is the <em>shape</em> of the wave that matters. For instance, the diagram above is what we call a <em>sine</em>
                        wave. Another wave pattern is the square wave, as shown below. This kind of wave is the most convenient kind of wwave in buzzers, for the square wave 
                        can easily be produced by sending out electric signals to the pin of the buzzer. An experiment related to the square wave is conducted, as described
                        below.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../asset/images/square_wave_diagram.jpg">

                    <h4>Two different process of producing sound: human vocal/productions in movies</h4>
                    <p>In this part, I conducted my research in two different parts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Human Vocal</li>
                        <li>Production of sound in movies/films</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h5>Human Vocal</h5>
                    <p>The main way for humans to pronounce sound is to control his/her throat. A gut of vibrating air, sent out by the trilling throat, forms vowels
                        and consonents by the obstruction of mouth. In the language <em>Quenya</em>, the process of pronouncing the vowel is described as "<em>
                            it is easy to feel how the air streams quite unhindered though the mouth: One merely configures the tongue and lips to "shape" the desired sound
                        </em>". Consonents, respectively, are similar.
                    </p>
                    <p>Many different approaches was made based on the human vocal. For instance, the function of voice-demanding in Siri, recognizes people based on the pattern
                        of their voices. Other interesting applications include the alteration of tune using Vocaloid or other softwares based on primitive voice recordings.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Production of sound in movies/films</h5>
                    <p>When a movie is being produced, its video is recorded prior, and its sound is synthesized later. The sound of movies include the background sound and the 
                        character's voices. While the voice of roles can be recorded in a recording room easily, creating sound for background is not that easy. The most popular
                        solution to this is to mimic the sound, or make it sound even better. Below is a research about the mimicing process.
                    </p>
                    <div class="row">
                        <div class="twelve columns">
                            <video controls="controls">

                        <p><em>Experiment & Research: Sound in Movies</em></p>
                    </div>
                    <p>It is interesting to notice the flexibility of how our brain handle the signal it received. When a sound passes through the air, it is conveyed into
                        electric signal by the ear, and ends up at the Auditiver Cortex of the brain through neurons. While our brain is processing, it breaks the sound apart 
                        into small parts. The final result of the recognition comes out by assembling these small pieces together. This algorithm is now widely used in 
                        the recognition process of artificial intelligence.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Electronics: Producing and Receiving Sounds —— The Earphone</h4>
                    <p>The last part that I looked into is the electronic version of producing and receiving sounds. Before actually getting into the details,
                        we need two knowledge prerequisites:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A force is exerted to a conductor with current inside when the conductor is in a magnetic field.</li>
                        <li>If a part of a circular circut is cutting the magnetic field lines, a current is created inside the circut.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Based on these basic knowledge, the <em>earphone</em> and the <em>microphone</em> is created. When the phone decided to play music, a small 
                        electric current is sent to the earphone, making the conductor inside the magnetic field vibrate. The frequency of the vibration depends on the 
                        intensity of the current, and is therefore controllable. The vibration causes the air to trill, thus the sound. The microphone works just the same
                        way. When sound is passed to the microphone, the small plate inside the microphone vibrates, causing the current in the conductor. This current
                        is then amplified and picked up by the computer/device attached, or even compressed into an audio file. Below are the images of earphones and microphones;
                        two experiments are conducted with the help of these principles.
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Projects</h3>
                    <p>After researching in the production and receive of sounds, I used the open-source chip <em>Arduino</em> to experiment with sound.</p>

                    <h4>Experiment 1: Manipulating the frequency of sounds created by a passive buzzer </h4>
                    <p>A passive buzzer is a device that can make sound by receiving electric signals. In order to give off notes, we have to manipulate the frequency 
                        of the sound being produced. This is done by sending out high/low electric signals with different time intervals, causing the parts in the buzzer
                        to vibrate. This way, the buzzer produces square waves with various frequencies.
                    </p>
                    <p>In order to help other learners understand the way of modelling sound and go through the process of producing sounds, I opened up a workshop,
                        giving them the experience of using coding to generate sounds. Below is the construction image and the generalized code for the workshop.

                    <h4>Experiment 2: Detection of sound & alarm when loudness reaches threshold </h4>
                    <p>My another attempt is to use the sound receiver (microphone) to measure the loudness of the sound around it, which is characterized as the amplitude
                        of the sound waves, as mentioned above. When a threshold of loudness is reached, the RGB light will turn red, sending out a warning.
                        This facility can be used to measure the quietness of a working space in Moonshot.
                    </p>
                    <p>The basic properties and working principles of the sound detector is a bit different with a regular microphone as described in the research part.
                        In reality, the microphone is connected to the Arduino chip by three pins: 5V, GND, and an input pin (for example, A0). The parts of vibrating
                        stays the same, but an additional screw serves the need to alter the threshold of sound loudness. When the limit is reached, the sound detector will 
                        convey the electric current from 5V to the input pin A0.
                    </p>

                    <p>Finally, I decided to voice for Aragorn, Legolas, and Boromir in the movie <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</em>. The video 
                        is shown below.</p>
