                    <h3>1. Thoughts Towards Driving Questions</h3>
                    <p>
                        Due to the limits of time and money, I came up with several driving questions, with their content and technical difficulties shown below.
                        <table>
                            <thead>
                                <tr>
                                    <th>Question Content</th>
                                    <th>Technical Difficulties</th>
                                </tr>
                            </thead>
                            <tbody>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>How to construct a pure optical logic gate?</td>
                                    <td>This is the first question being proposed. We already came up with a design of pure optical logic gates, but it requires
                                        polarization lens as well as semi-reflective glasses which we cannot afford.
                                    </td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>How to achieve 4D Modelling with Computer Graphics?</td>
                                    <td>This hypothesis is not achievable under the restrictions of the current time. Therefore, I will ponder through this question
                                        in my final project.
                                    </td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>How to create life using Persistent of Vision?</td>
                                    <td>This is my final driving question in this project. To build a "life", I uses an Arduino Mega, 1 accelerometer, 32 LEDs, 2 Breadboards,
                                        and a lot lot lot lot lot jumper cables.
                                    </td>
                                </tr>
                            </tbody>
                        </table>
                    </p>

                    <h3>2. Thoughts before the project</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am a computer scientist, therefore considers everything in a logical and computer-based way. I consider our world as a giant system,
                        where everything acts based on fundamental rules (for example, gravity). Similarly, I can create a different world in the field of computer science
                        with new rules and new principles. This is one of the reasons of why I like computer science: you are the god of your own world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While thinking of putting art and science together, I thought of creating a "life" that follows rules, seemingly spontaneous, reacts, and tells.
                        Therefore, I designed this "life" that behaves on its own, obeying certain rules, and transfers information to us by rotating itself and using the
                         "persistent of vision" (POV) with LEDs.
                    </p>

                    <h3>3. Getting the materials</h3>
                    <p><strong>List of Materials</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Arduino Mega x1</li>
                        <li>A bunch of Blue LEDs</li>
                        <li>2 Breadboards</li>
                        <li>Numerous Jumper Cables</li>
                        <li>Soldering Iron & Solder</li>
                        <li>Insulated Tape</li>
                        <li>1 Electronic drill</li>
                        <li>Accelerometer: MPU6050</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>4. Making the facility</h3>
                    <p>In order to make the facility look neater, I sawed through the breadboards and soldered wires to the back of the breadboards.</p>
