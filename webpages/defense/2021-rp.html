                                your artifact to let the jury member better understand where the artifact is from?

                                The context of doing this project is: 1) I developed an interest in computer graphics in doing a 3D game <em>HugeLand</em> with my peers, and continued learning Computer Graphics from Professor Brian Barsky of University
                                of California, Berkeley; 2) I was frustrated by drawing multiple repeated drafts of a sensor rig I was designing in my solar panel project from different perspectives because of its complexity; and 3) I was doing the new
                                Makerspace design of the new campus.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But doing a 3D modelling is not a great compensation method: It is too costly and rigid for designers, and has a steep learning curves. Existing heavy-weight 3D software packages are usually not suitable for ideation. Therefore, I designed and developed
                                an 3D sketching app that targets a more natural way for prototyping in 3D: users can create a sketch in 3D and view it from multiple perspectives, without having to create multiple 2D sketches.

                            In the first part, I explained how I got the inspiration and prerequisite knowledge of this project. In this part I will explain my learning process and development process:

                                    Brainstorm all the features according to other sketching/3D modelling applications, and assign their priorities;
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Perform staged developments and periodic testings;

                                    When the application has the basic features, put the example into the sketching application and create demos for paper;
                                </li>
                                <li>

                                This research process can be used in any of my future research projects; the design, develop, and testing process of the application can be used in any of my projects in college. I find it challenging for myself to create a rough plan estimating how much
                                time each development stage needs, and I usually miss the deadlines; in the future I will aim for better estimations and choice making of whether leave or implement a feature.
