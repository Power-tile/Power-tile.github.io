            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>In this webpage, I will briefly talk about my XA Artifact for Defense 2020: My Coding Experience this year. I will divide my experience 
                into several sections by content/method of learning, along with various evidences, videos, image peaks, and webpage contents that are parts
                of my learning.

            <p>In the course <em>Computer Science 2</em>, I learned about Java, Spring, Springboot, AOP, OOP Principles, SQL + JPA, and more technologies.
                These seemingly terrifying names are targetting to build a website with a healthy database that stores the information of users as well 
                as keeping track of all actions, a backend client that helps handling users' requests, and a frontend webpage which the user can view
                and facilitate their needs with an user interface.
            </p>
            <p>Our final project in this course is to build a virtual "vending machine" website. Users can select their products, choose various discounts
                to spend less money, and buy their products. This website is connected to a database which holds the information of products and users' 
                accounts.
            </p>
            <p>A sneak peek to the user interface of my vending machine project:</p>

            <img class="img-fluid" src="../../asset/images/comp3001-vending-machine-boot-demo-2.png">
            <p class="text-secondary">P.S. This webpage needs to run on a server that provides the appropriate environment, and a special server needs to be rented for 
                running the backend of this webpage. It is a pity that you cannot try the selection process by yourself.
            </p>

            <p>If you want access to the full code: This project is open-source on Github. For the earliest console version without a frontend and 
                database, click <em><a href="https://github.com/Power-tile/vendingmachine" target="_blank">here</a></em>; for the version with frontend and database,
                click <em><a href="https://github.com/Power-tile/vending-machine-boot" target="_blank">here</a></em>.
            </p>

            <p>Dashboard is a platform for publishing school information and status of learners (for example, rate of attendance, 
                competency level, learning evidences, milestone grades and comments), facing guardians (faculty members), learners, and parents. 
                I engaged in both development processes for Dashboard 1 and Dashboard 2 in this year.</p>
            <p>For Dashboard 1, I engaged in small-scale full stack development since March 2019. A screenshot from the old version of Dashboard 1:</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../../asset/images/dashboard-1-demo.png">
            <p class="text-secondary">P.S. This is the old version of dashboard and this screenshot is from an expired message in the dev group chat.
                Currently the newest data is hosted on Dashboard 2, and a screen capture of the current Dashboard 1 will be mostly blank (no data imported).
            </p>

            <p>For Dashboard 2, I focused on frontend development and finished about 60% of the frontend page since the beginning
                of the spring semester of 2020. In this process I also learned and used a new UI library called <code>Bootstrap</code>. A screenshot
                of the current competency model page of dashboard 2 (I coded the competency evidence chart):</p>

            <p>I also coded the defense grading application that defense panel members use:</p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../../asset/images/dashboard-defense-app-demo-1.png">
            <p>Here, defense panel members can view the artifact provided by defendant, the requirements for each competencies, and project descriptions;
                grade competency by each skill strand; give feedback to each artifact; and export all data to a csv file. This application also supports
                saving data after closure of browser unexpectedly.

            <p>As the club leader of the SCP Makerspace Club, we decided to make a final project. After several discussions, we decide to make a 
                <em>physical</em> vending machine, where learners and guardians can buy products and random boxes from. I am now leading the web group
                which aims to developing a phone webpage application that allows users to choose products online.
            </p>
            <p>In this project, I focus more on tracking works and helping other learners by doing code review. A screenshot of our tower planner task:</p>

            <p>Frank and I was collaborating on coding the program for sensor rig. I know that Frank is quite clear about the actual code needed
                for controlling the sensors, and we covered all basic information needed to interpret a new arduino library in our SCP C++ Workshop
                (see below). However, he never collaborated coding with others before, and he is not very familiar with the algorithm used or the design
                of the sensor rig physical structure (which was done by me). Therefore, I decided to write the skeleton of the code, only declaring but not
                defining the control functions. A peak to the skeleton I wrote:

            <p>In order to estimate the solar panel power generation, I used Python and several popular libraries (<code>numpy</code>,
                <code>pandas</code>, etc.) to analyze the data from Google's project sunroof. Combined with data of solar radiation of Beijing,
                I did a rough estimation on the power generation amount. Rough screenshot:

            <p>I was the teacher assistant of COMP2001 class in the fall 2019 semester, and I was responsible for teaching part of the class, 
                coding and projecting my computer when Jerry is teaching, writing answers for milestones, etc. The contents of the class are 
                Terminal Languages, Javascript, and HTML+CSS.
            </p>
            <p>For the first part of the class, we were teaching Terminal Languages, and we divided into two groups (Windows and Mac).
                I was in charge of the windows part of teaching, and I made a tutorial website covering the most important parts of the course:

            <h2>Workshop on C++ in SCP Makerspace Club</h2>
            <p>I opened up about 30 workshops on C++, and the total length of the workshops is about 20 hours. The workshops cover the basics of
                C++ procedural grammar and data types; Arduino Programming and how to search + use a new sensor on the Internet; basic algorithms (DFS, BFS, 
                selection sort, quick sort); and intermediate grammar in C++ (<code>struct</code>, macros, <code>vector</code>, <code>pointers</code>, etc.).

                as a tool for evaluating myself, but also added new skills and challenges to the Matrix. I worked on the field of C++ briefly, and I will
                add more skills in the future. A screenshot to the skills I added to the matrix:

            <h2>Vue Playground</h2>
            <p>Developing in Vue.js and Iview UI, I found that both analyzing the code from an existing project and starting from scratch are not 
                the best way of learning these (because of the vast knowledge points in both libraries). Therefore, I created a github project called
                "Vue Playground" and added a few challenges + code needed to interpret it. A challenge completed may look like this:
            </p>
            <img src="../../asset/videos/vue-playground-demo-1.gif" class="img-fluid">
            <p>Learners can try to achieve the challenge according to the Demo GIF, and check the answer code provided. These demos are often based on
                real needs from projects, so they can be easily migrated to other webpages as well.

            <h1>Conclusion</h1>
            <p>In this year, I mostly engaged in building my skills in development + sharing what I know with others. I became more mastered on
                Java, JS+HTML+CSS, Python, C++, and other programming languages. I also used my knowledge to affect more people.
