                                This essay, or document-based question (DBQ), is written in my AP World History course. We finished learning the French and American revolution periods in the late 18th century, and decided to reflect on different effects of these two revolutions as well
                                as their similarities and differences. This is to create a prerequisite knowledge for our later learning of 1) 19th century nationalism development, and 2) the underlying causes and fuses of WWI, and ultimately to the semester
                                questions 3) how nationalism reshaped the world and 4) what is the form of nationalism at today. I chose the prompt <em>With reference to the French and American revolutions, discuss how politics changed in the 18th century</em>.

                                I created an ambitious thesis: <em>the political consequences caused by each event are highly correlated with the extent of influence from which the Enlightenment spirits imposed</em>. I defended it well by breaking down
                                the logic sequence of my argument:

                                I wrote my claims above into this 2200-word essay, and supported my claims using 25 document sources, in which 9 are from the provided document sources (required 7), 8 are primary sources (required 4), and 7 are outer sources of academic papers/published
                                books. I practiced my skills in developing complex claims and logic lines, create claims from different academic sources, explain my ideas while pointing back to my main thesis; I learned how to write academically using
                                proper formats and tenses; and I learned extra facts and insights on the two important revolutions.

                                I developed my own way of organizing ideas for long thesis-driven essays:
                                <ol>

                                    <li>Start by searching for the Wikipedia pages of the key words in prompt, and write down logic causations; start labelling the document using:</li>

                                        <li><span class="badge badge-info">FORM</span> Great claim, but need to be reformatted/put in other places;</li>
                                        <li><span class="badge badge-danger">DEL</span> Included in the preparation documentation for completeness, consider deleting in final passage.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <li>Start resolving the labels in the previous step and add additional details; repeat step 2. and 3. until I am satisfied with my work;</li>
                                    <li>Start writing the essay.</li>
                                </ol>
                                Not only did I developed my essay-writing tactics, I also created more in-depth thoughts in system thinking (how change-over-time in plot and context effect each other; in-depth comparison, etc.); cultural and intercultural understanding and research
                                between America and France; and also my skills in writing and expressing.

                                My method of writing papers can be expanded on any long thesis-driven essay assignments in my college; the experience of information literacy and source research will benefit me in every college-level class. Some challenges I encountered in this project
                                includes extracting main ideas, as well as choosing to include or delete complex claims from large amounts of resources. This is a must-do for every big project: to control which parts to focus and which parts to not. My
                                next steps of improvement consist of better language organization and better source selection (My goal: 0 Wikipedia Pages!!!).
