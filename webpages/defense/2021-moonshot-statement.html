                <h2>Moonshot Statement - Daniel He</h2>
                <p>
                    When I started writing this document, my memory traced me back to June 2019, when I wrote, in innocent but bold words, a cover letter that spoke of connecting the world I knew to computer science: “I imagine our world one single simulation of an infinite
                    set of simulations, as one possibility against all”; “for my high school, I assigned ‘Moonshot Academy’ to it; this is not only a string-typed value but also a pointer to a huge object, the community”; “every learner and guardian I
                    met was a wonderful instance, having its unique properties and methods”. Though as I learned more in the world around me, these childish thoughts became more bizarre and innocent, my passion in computer science had never changed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My first passion in computer science was inspired by its mysteriousness. Just as Victor Frankenstein, who was afraid by but fascinated with the power of electricity, and the character Born from the video game Nihilumbra, mistaking moving machines as life,
                    I was simply drawn to computer science by the desire to know more, to rip out the black box and observe the inside. As my friends described, I was simply “learning for fun”. I was non-stop pondering, splashing into the deep water of
                    computer science, eager to learn more and share these wonderful sparks with others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These great pieces of knowledge forged fascinating ideas in my imagination. I started creating projects. My first trial of organizing: creating a 3D game “HugeLand” with a group of learners. Our passion to create something cool was slowly dampened by
                    our lack of skill. Seeing a project team become inert was as frustrating as ever: I realized I need to solve the challenge of lacking of skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s why I co-founded Makerspace with my peers. I defined makers as “people who have the courage, ability, and imagination to make.” I taught workshops aiming to dampen the stereotype “computer science is for nerds”. I co-developed Matrix, a huge sheet
                    that tracks learning and related evidence, facilitating decentralized learning as learners can learn from others’ materials. I believe that knowledge structured for the purpose of teaching facilitates deeper understanding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Slowly but surely, these actions are taking progress. I observed learners who participated in my workshops got motivation in taking computer science classes, even becoming teaching assistants. I co-founded and co-held 30 Build Nights, activities that
                    invite outer makers to come to our campus and co-make with our learners and guardians. But as I continued designing and opening new workshops, I realized my goal of decentralized learning is far: by myself doing campus-based activities,
                    the people that I can radiate to is limited.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is something I will continue exploring in my college experience. Just as in Moonshot, I will put what I learned into application. I plan to join educational technology research projects and seek for methods to contribute. I will create an official
                    account that records my learning, connect it to the Matrix, and become a more stable source of knowledge radiating to more people. I will continue making and sharing wonderful projects in the new makerspace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will continue exploring my academic interest in my college, the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My previous learnings created a complete overview for the field of computer science; my goal is to stay curious to all but deeply research into
                    a few aspects. I am aiming to complete a double major in also electrical engineering, connecting the fundamentals of computer science to the physical world we know.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will also continue my favorite sport, frisbee, in my new school. In Moonshot, frisbee is already binded with our school spirit: its spirit of equality, respect, and active listening. I will play ultimate frisbee with people I know not in the country
                    where the sport started.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, I would like to enjoy my life at a new city. In Beijing, I experienced the autumn leaves of Xiangshan, visited the Forbidden Palace and Wangfujing; I overslept my station in the subway, wandered in the middle of the night with friends doing a
                    project, and tasted great cuisine. I will not wrong myself in my new college: I will enjoy the corn festivals, try out and love sports I never touched, and make friends of all ethnicity and race. When choosing courses, I designed my
                    first semester to be extremely empty, giving me the opportunity to expand my comfort zone when everyone is new.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am not worried, neither for my future nor for myself. I am ready to handle what's moving toward me, and yearn for what lays before.
